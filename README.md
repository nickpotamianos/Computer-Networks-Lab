## Project Overview

This repository contains six exercises focused on computer networks and routing. The exercises include setting up network topologies in GNS3, configuring routers, verifying connectivity, and analyzing routing tables and protocols. The exercises also include Linux command-line operations for testing network connectivity and managing IP routing.

## Exercises

### Askisi 1 - GNS3 Project

This exercise involves setting up a network topology in GNS3 and configuring various PCs and routers to verify communication between different devices. It covers:
- Assigning IP addresses.
- Verifying communication with `ping`.
- Configuring routing tables.

### Askisi 2 - Network Lab

In this exercise, a specific network topology is built using GNS3. IPs are assigned to routers, and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing is enabled. Key tasks include:
- Assigning IPs to routers.
- Enabling OSPF routing.
- Verifying connectivity with `ping` and viewing routing tables.

### Askisi 3 - GNS3 Routing

This exercise focuses on verifying routing paths between different network devices using `ip route print` and `ping` commands. The aim is to ensure proper routing from internal networks to the external network.

### Askisi 4 - Linux Commands

A series of Linux network commands are executed to test network interfaces and routing:
- `ip a` to display IP addresses.
- `ping 8.8.8.8` to test network connectivity.
- `traceroute 8.8.8.8` to trace the path to an external IP.

### Askisi 5 - Routing Verification

This exercise involves verifying the routing paths and communication between routers in a network topology. Key tasks include:
- Checking routing paths with `ip route print`.
- Performing `ping` tests between devices.
- Executing `traceroute` to confirm external network reachability.

### Askisi 6 - VLANs and Routing

The final exercise deals with VLANs and routing. The exercise covers:
- Verifying access to external networks.
- Ensuring communication between devices in the same and different VLANs.
- Testing terminal access and network segmentation.
